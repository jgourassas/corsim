## CORSIM Is a simple and naive  simulation of Coronary Angiographic Views and Angulations.

### The porpuse of this software to show - Help students /  fellows-in-training to be used with coronary views


### Notes
-  The coronary  data points are from  the paper of Dodge et al Circulation Vol 86, No 1 July 1992

-  The Best fluoroscopic viewing angles are highly variable across the Patients. 
   In Real Life please have as guide  the angles as are described in the referring papers and in the table widget

- The Terminology of coronary segments is according the Dodge  Article. No attempt was made to translate to newer ones (AHA, CDISC - www.cdisc.org)
